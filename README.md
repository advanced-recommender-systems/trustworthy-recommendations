# Trustworthy Recommender Systems: Foundations and Frontiers


# Abstract
Recommender systems aim to help users make appropriate decisions effectively and efficiently by providing personalized suggestions in our daily lives. Despite their great success, recent evidence shows that advanced recommender systems can expose their untrustworthy aspects to various stakeholders, leading to harmful effects in many real-world applications, especially those in safety-critical areas such as finance and healthcare. 
This tutorial will provide a comprehensive overview of achieving trustworthy recommender systems from six important aspects: Safety \& Robustness, Non-discrimination \& Fairness, Explainability, Privacy, Environmental Well-being, Accountability \& Auditability.
Particularly, we will give the basic definition and taxonomy for each aspect, followed by the latest research progress and their most representative works. After that, we will discuss potential interactions among different aspects and possible future research directions for trustworthy recommender systems.
